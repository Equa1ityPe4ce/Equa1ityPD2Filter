# Equa1ity's PD2 Filter
Loot Filter For Project Diablo 2

How To Install
All that is needed is to Download the default.filter file. Then drop file in your DiabloII/ProjectDiablo2 folder (The one with all the game files in it) A pop up will ask if you would like to Replace existing file select yes.  Close game and reopen Or press 0 on number pad after 1st install of file to activate it if game is currently open.

_Note_ There is a darkMode folder that is also kind of fun to use,  it's not for everyone to access navigate into the 3.0 darkmode folder and use that default.filter file instead
